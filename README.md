## Introduction

Providing clean air and water is not just an environmental imperative but a cornerstone of human health, economic prosperity, and societal well-being. Both air and water pollution rank among the most pressing global environmental challenges, with far-reaching consequences for individuals, communities, and ecosystems. These pollutants are directly linked to an array of health problems, ranging from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases to waterborne illnesses. The impacts extend beyond immediate health issues, contributing to reduced life expectancy, lower quality of life, and increased vulnerability to other health conditions. For example, previous studies have indicated that poor air quality potentially causes various health problems, including stroke, ischemic heart disease, lung cancer, respiratory infection, and chronic pulmonary disease. Water is frequently polluted because the industry has been growing every year on the back of spiralling demand, and hazardous waste is discharged into the rivers and lakes by those industries.

The scale of these challenges is staggering. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution is responsible for approximately 7 million premature deaths annually, a figure that underscores its severity as a public health crisis. Meanwhile, Microbiologically contaminated drinking water can transmit diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid and polio and is estimated to cause approximately 505 000 diarrhoeal deaths each year.

In addition to the health implications, According to WHO in 53 countries, the economic cost of deaths alone accounts for over $ 1.4 trillion. Adding another 10% to this, as the cost of diseases from air pollution, results in a total of almost $ 1.6 trillion. Similarly, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) water pollution has diverse and far-reaching effects on the economy, impacting tourism, property values, commercial fishing, recreational businesses and many other sectors that depend on clean water. These economic pressures not only strain national economies and healthcare systems but also hinder broader development efforts, particularly in regions where resources are already scarce.

Recognizing the critical importance of clean air and water, global organizations such as the United Nations (UN) and WHO have emphasized the need for urgent action. The UN's sustainable development goals (SDGs) explicitly highlight the necessity of ensuring access to clean water and sustainable urban air quality under Goals 6 and 11, respectively. These goals serve as a blueprint for addressing pollution through coordinated international efforts, policy interventions, and technological innovation.

Technological advancements offer promising pathways for tackling pollution. Innovations such as real-time air quality monitoring, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered predictive models, and advanced water treatment systems hold significant potential to mitigate the harmful effects of pollution. Through machine learning (ML) driven analysis of emerging trends, this approach identifies promising research avenues with potential for significant impact.

## Project Overview

EcoVision is a graduation project aimed at developing a comprehensive environmental monitoring and analysis system. Our goal is to leverage cutting-edge technologies, including real-time sensor data, machine learning algorithms, and cloud computing, to provide actionable insights into air and water quality.

### Key Features
